# GitHub flavored Markdown with LaTeX package
This grammar supports a modified version of GitHub flavored Markdown, with added support of embedded LaTeX code.

[Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) can compile documents with embedded LaTeX into pure LaTeX documents.

Adds syntax highlighting and snippets to [GitHub flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown) files in Atom.

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.
